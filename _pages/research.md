# <span style="color:#5E9CA0;">Development of highly sensitive detection methods</span> 
### 1. EPISENS-S method (2022)
![Research image_1](../assets/images/research_EPISENS_S.jpg)
- Detect viruses in solid fractions of wastewater
- Simple method without additonal investiment for equipment
- Approximately 100 times senstive than a conventional method
- Pelleting is a critical step for the viral detection
- Affected by the amount of solids

### 2. EPISENS-M method (2023)
![Research image_2](../assets/images/research_EPISENS_M.jpg)
- Approximately 100 times senstive than a conventional method
- Capture viruses in both solid and liquid fractions of wastewater
- Applicable to raw wastewater, treated wastewater, and environmental water 
- Applicable to envelope and non-envelope viruses

### 3. Detection of respiratory and gastroenteritics viruses (2023-2024)
![Research image_3](../assets/images/research_detection.jpg)
- Use the EPISENS-M method
- Influenza A virus and Respiratory syncytial virus
- Norovirus, Rotavirus, Sapovirus, and Aichivirus
- First study for long-term wastewater surveillance in Japan
- Reveal epidemic dynamics of the infectious viruses before and during COVID-19
- Lead to social implementation of wastewater surveillance in Sapporo city, Japan
