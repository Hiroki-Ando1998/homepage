- Detect viruses in solid fractions of wastewater
- Simple method without additonal investiment for equipment
- Approximately 100 times senstive than a conventional method
- Pelleting is a critical step for detection
- Vulnerable to precipitation

### 2. EPISENS-M method (2023)

- Approximately 100 times senstive than a conventional method
- Collect viruses in both solid and liquid fraction of wastewater
- Applicable to environmental water and treated wastewater
- Applicable to envelope and non-envelope viruses

### 3. Detection of respiratory and gastroenteritics viruses (2023-2024)
- Use the EPISENS-M method
- Influenza A virus and Respiratory syncytial virus
- Norovirus, Rotavirus, Sapovirus, and Aichivirus
- First study for long-term wastewater surveillance in Japan
- Reveal epidemic dynamics of the infectious viruses before and during COVID-19
- Lead to social implementation of wastewater surveillance in Sapporo city, Japan
